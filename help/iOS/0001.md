## Why the location of my apps on device's home screen has changed ?

When you enable the session, selected apps on your device, including those on the home screen, app library, and notifications, will be hidden until you choose to stop the session. It's important to note that once the session is stopped, your apps will be restored, but the location of these apps on your home screen may be different than before.

Please keep in mind that we are unable to control how or where the apps will be restored on your home screen due to Apple restrictions. However, you can choose to restore the apps only in your App Library by going to System Settings, selecting "Home Screen", and setting "Newly Downloaded Apps" to "App Library Only"."
